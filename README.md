# Instagram_unfollowers

A simple script that generates a list of accounts that don't follow you back on Instagram using 're'.
Expected input files should be: 'followers.html' and 'following.html' extracted from the archive generated by Instagram when you choose download data.
It generates a '.txt" file that can be used to unfollow accounts manually.
